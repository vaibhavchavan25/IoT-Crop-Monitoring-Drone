## 🧩 Abstract
Agricultural monitoring is a critical challenge for large-scale farms, where environmental variation directly affects productivity.  
This project develops an **IoT-based crop monitoring drone** equipped with environmental sensors and wireless communication modules.  
The drone transmits live sensor readings and aerial imagery to a **mobile application**, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding irrigation, pest control, and crop health.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and fabricate a drone integrated with IoT sensors.  
- Capture and transmit real-time agricultural data wirelessly.  
- Develop a mobile app for monitoring environmental parameters.  
- Enhance decision-making for irrigation and crop management.  
- Contribute to smart agriculture through embedded IoT systems.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
-Data Acquisition: Sensors (DHT11, soil moisture) collect environmental data.
-Drone Operation: A camera mounted on the drone captures plant images during flight.
-Processing: ESP32 handles data processing and camera control.
-Transmission: Sensor data is sent to the government crop monitoring mobile app.
-Image Handling: All captured images are automatically saved to the user’s mobile phone gallery.
-Decision Support: Farmers use both visual images and sensor data for crop analysis.
