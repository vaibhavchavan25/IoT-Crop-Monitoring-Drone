## 🧩 Abstract
This project presents an **IoT-based crop monitoring drone** integrated with a mobile application for real-time agricultural observation.  
The system provides a cost-effective and efficient way for farmers to monitor crop health, environmental conditions, and soil parameters through a wireless drone platform.  
The drone collects sensor data (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and aerial images, transmitting them via IoT to a mobile app interface for data visualization and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To design and fabricate a drone equipped with environmental sensors and IoT connectivity.  
2. To capture real-time agricultural data and transmit it wirelessly to a user interface.  
3. To integrate a mobile application for monitoring and analyzing live crop data.  
4. To assist farmers in early identification of plant stress, irrigation needs, and pest risks.  
5. To contribute toward the development of a sustainable smart agriculture model.
